## Secret Manager
To securely manage secrets, follow these steps:

2. Add your secrets in the following format:
    ```
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    API_TOKEN=your_api_token
    ```
3. Ensure the `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to version control.
4. The application will automatically load secrets from the `.env` file using a library like `python-dotenv`.
